# Changelog

## [0.11.2] - 2026-07-25

### Infrastructure
- **Linux Tarball Distribution**: Replaced AUR-based distribution with a portable `.tar.gz` tarball distribution system (same as ActOne). The tarball ships with `install.sh` and `uninstall.sh` scripts for system-wide installation.
- **GitHub Release Automation**: Replaced the AUR publish script with `publish-github-release.sh`, which builds the tarball and pushes it as a GitHub release asset.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-06-29

### Fixes
- **PDF Export Crash**: Fixed a crash when exporting large files with dirty formatted Fountain markup.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-20

### Maturity Milestone
- **Project Status (v0.11.0)**: Fount has reached a highly mature milestone. The application is running smoothly, passing all unit tests, compiler checks, and code lints. Since the core feature set is now complete and solid for daily writing, development will transition to a slower pace, focusing primarily on bug fixes, performance maintenance, and ensuring long-term compatibility.

### Fixes
- **X-Ray Theme Contrast**: Fixed the font color contrast of character pair names in the X-Ray "Interactions" panel. Character pair names now dynamically inherit the theme's primary foreground color, making them perfectly readable in light themes (like "Lilac" and "Paper") instead of defaulting to terminal text color.

### Internal & Refactoring
- **Clippy Code Polish**: Resolved clippy lint warnings regarding collapsible nested if-let structures in TUI list rendering, ensuring a clean and zero-warning build state.

## [0.10.2] - 2026-05-19

### Improvements
- **Industry Standard PDF Margins**: Completely overhauled the PDF export engine to strictly adhere to the Final Draft formatting standard.
- **Absolute Element Anchoring**: Scene headings, action, dialogue, and character names now use exact absolute distances from the left edge (1.5", 2.5", 3.7", etc.), guaranteeing identical pagination and pacing regardless of whether you export to US Letter or A4.
- **Dynamic Right Margins**: Fount now dynamically calculates right margins to enforce the strict 6.0" maximum action block width and 3.5" dialogue width across all paper sizes.
- **Centered Lyrics**: Fixed Lyrics formatting to ensure they are properly centered, italicized, and elegantly indented rather than sticking to the right margin.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-05-18

### Changes
- **Windows Mode**: Introduced a dedicated Windows Mode for terminal compatibility, replacing the old ASCII-forcing approach with a smarter, platform-aware rendering strategy.
- **Removed `force_ascii`**: Dropped the legacy `force_ascii` configuration option in favor of the new Windows Mode.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-18

### New features
- **Smart Delimiter Newlines**: Pressing `Enter` directly before trailing screenplay markup delimiters (like `]]`, `*/`, `**`, `*`, `_`, `<`, `)`, `"`, `'`) now leaves them cleanly on the active line, automatically creating a new paragraph or line below.
- **Index Cards Vector Synopsis**: Replaced single synopsis inputs with a vector field in the Index Cards modal, allowing interactive editing of multi-paragraph scene synopses.
- **Horizontal Index Card Reordering**: Added support for horizontally shifting and reordering index cards using `Shift + Left/Right` with active, live visual move indicators.
- **Dynamic Page Sizing**: Implemented real-time page-specific line calculations and configuration options supporting custom page sizes (A4 vs US Letter).
- **Modular X-Ray Studio**: Completely upgraded the X-Ray analytics interface to feature sub-panes: **Pulse** (pacing analysis), **Ensemble** (character statistics table), **Blueprint** (scene metrics), and **Inventory** (metadata tracking).
- **Collapsible Scene Tree**: Added nested sequence collapsible hierarchy support in the sidebar scene tree navigation view.
- **Active Writing Sprints**: Added active writing session and sprint tracking to the UI with conflict prevention and enhanced footer status indicators.

### Improvements
- **TUI File Picker & Two-Stage Save**: Completely overhauled the integrated TUI File Picker for opening and saving screenplay files, featuring a safer two-stage saving flow with automatic extension validation and active "dirty" buffer tracking inside UI labels.
- **Note Rendering Performance**: Drastically improved screenplay rendering loop speeds by implementing dynamic invalidation caches for layout line calculations of hidden/note blocks.
- **Footer UI Simplification**: Streamlined the bottom footer status displays and refined the dynamic cursor positioning mechanics.

### Under the Hood / Tests
- **Randomized Monkey Testing**: Integrated a new high-frequency randomized stress testing module for application input stability.
