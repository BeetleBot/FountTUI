## ✍️ Developer's Note

> [!NOTE]
> **Project Status (v0.11.0)**
> Fount has reached a highly mature milestone. With version 0.11.0, the application is running smoothly, passing all unit tests, compiler checks, and code lints. Since the core feature set is now complete and solid for daily writing, development will transition to a slower pace, focusing primarily on bug fixes, performance maintenance, and ensuring long-term compatibility rather than major new features.

> [!NOTE]
> **A Letter from the Creator**
> 
> As a credited Tamil/Indian screenwriter—writing predominantly in **English and Tanglish**—I found myself at a crossroads when I transitioned to Linux. I deeply missed **[Beat](https://github.com/lmparppei/Beat)**, my long-time companion for storytelling, and couldn't find a minimalist alternative that felt "right" in the terminal.
> 
> My search led me to **[Lottie](https://github.com/coignard/lottie)**, whose elegance immediately captivated me. I cloned the project and began shaping it into the tool I needed. While I possess a moderate grasp of Rust, this journey was significantly smoothed by the partnership of **AI Agents like Claude and Gemini**. They were instrumental in helping me overcome technical hurdles, complicated logic, and the often frustrating nuances of software release workflows. Fount is the result of my creative vision and writing background, the open-source code that inspired me, and the intelligence of the agents that helped me build it. It is a tool I use daily, and I hope it serves you just as well.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **A Note on Pagination**
> Due to TUI constraints, page counts shown in the editor are only approximate. Layouts for A4 and US Letter may have up to a +/- 2 pages difference in the TUI view. The TUI pagination is an approximation; only the final export contains the true, definitive page count.

## 🏛️ Inspiration & Credits

Fount stands on the shoulders of giants. This project would not have been possible without the inspiration and foundational work of the following:

1.  **[Lottie](https://github.com/coignard/lottie)**: My immediate inspiration. Fount began as a fork and evolution of this beautiful terminal editor.
2.  **[Beat](https://github.com/lmparppei/Beat)**: The gold standard for minimalist screenwriting software. Fount is my attempt to bring the spirit of Beat to the Linux terminal.
3.  **[Fountain.io](https://github.com/nyousefi/Fountain)**: The universal screenplay format that powers modern independent screenwriting.
