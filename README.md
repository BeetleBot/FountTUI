## ✍️ Developer's Note

> [!NOTE]
> **A Letter from the Creator**
> 
> As a credited Tamil/Indian screenwriter—writing predominantly in **English and Tanglish**—I found myself at a crossroads when I transitioned to Linux. I deeply missed **[Beat](https://github.com/lmparppei/Beat)**, my long-time companion for storytelling, and couldn't find a minimalist alternative that felt "right" in the terminal.
> 
> My search led me to **[Lottie](https://github.com/coignard/lottie)**, whose elegance immediately captivated me. I cloned the project and began shaping it into the tool I needed. While I possess a moderate grasp of Rust, this journey was significantly smoothed by the partnership of **AI Agents like Claude and Gemini**. 
> 
> AI was instrumental in helping me overcome technical hurdles, complicated logic, and the often frustrating nuances of software release workflows. Fount is the result of my creative vision and little bit of coding background, the open-source code that inspired me, and the intelligence of the agents that helped me build it. It is a tool I use daily, and I hope it serves you just as well.
